This repository is for TeeZone: Developing an Online Platform for Selling College T-Shirts for INTI International College Penang

Most college students now choose to purchase online, which has caused a change in the fashion retail business. Due to this, TeeZone was developed to make it easy for students at INTI International College Penang to buy t-shirts online for a variety of events, activities, or personal usage. The platform's main goal is to give every student a simple, secure, and friendly buying experience that satisfies their needs, whether they are for event t-shirts or casual clothes. With these goals, TeeZone hopes to integrate fashion and technology into an easy-to-use platform that enables students to buy t-shirts for a variety of occasions.
